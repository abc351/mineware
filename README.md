# MINEWARE - FAKE Ransomware Program

No Encryption, No Data Corruption, No Money Demand :-)

It only renames maximum 5 files, no encryption whatsoever (NO encryption code in the code)

To restore the file,

* Delete the extension at the end of each file individually (if the program is out of order)

* Beat Minesweeper (recommended, auto-run, files will be restored immediately)

* Just wait 2 minutes (you don't have to beat with it)

In celebration of April Fool's Day 2023...

p.s.Â If you close Minesweeper in a while -> files will be restored after 2 minutes.
